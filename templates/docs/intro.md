# Introduction

The game is set in a modern-day world where you are the leader of a state. You must gather resources from your state,
create equipment and armor with those resources, and supply this equipment and armor to troops. Then you can use those
troops to conquer other states and expand your empire.

The game is played on a map of the world. Each state on the map has its own resources, such as gold, oil, and farmland.
You can send your troops to the states to gather these resources. The more troops you have, the more resources you can
gather.

Once you have gathered the resources, you can use them to create equipment and armor for your troops. The better the
equipment and armor, the better your troops will be in combat. You can also use the resources to build new buildings,
such as factories and military bases. These buildings will help you to train your troops, improve your economy, and
build alliances with other states.

Once your army is ready, you can send them to conquer other states. The more states you conquer, the more resources and
troops you will have. The goal of the game is to conquer as many states as possible and become the most powerful empire
in the world.
